# Company Home Page + Responsive Club Website

This project requires a company home page to be designed and built using flexbox.

The home page I've decided to build is my own portfolio home page.

Upon viewing the next project in the course, "Responsive Club Website", I've discovered that I've completed all of the objectives for that project in this one.
Therefore I've decided to merge the 2 projects together.
