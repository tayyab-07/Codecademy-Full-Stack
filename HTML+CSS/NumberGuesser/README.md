# Number Guesser 

In this project, i had to create some function in JavaScript to complete the functionality of a website.
I was given the complete HTML and CSS code along with the game.js file.
I completed everything in the script.js file to finish the game and have it working the way it should.

The starting point for the project can be found in the 'brief' directory.
